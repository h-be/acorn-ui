## This code now lives at [https://github.com/h-be/acorn](https://github.com/h-be/acorn) in the `web` folder.


# acorn-ui

the user interface for Acorn app, see [acorn-hc](https://github.com/h-be/acorn-hc) for backend

### UI

Developing the UI is simple. You will need to already be running the Holochain Conductor in
order to also develop the UI, since they are now coupled.

> **Prerequisite** have nodejs installed

Open a terminal to this folder

Run the following command

```
npm install
```

Now run

```
npm start
```

A browser window will open, displaying the UI.

For documentation on the `src` code, check out the [README there](./src/README.md)

#### Nix option

Use the nix shell to have npm installed and run npm install and start.

```shell
nix-shell --run acorn-ui
```

#### Building For Release

To set the version number for the release:
1. update the `version.current` and `version.previous` properties of `config.nix`
2. update the `version` property of `package.json` to the same thing as `version.current`

Use the nix shell.

```shell
nix-shell --run acorn-build
```

Pass a version of acorn-hc release to build for that specific one (there is a default fallback)

```shell
nix-shell --run 'acorn-build 0.3.5'
```

This will produce a file under `dist/acorn-ui.zip` with all the assets
